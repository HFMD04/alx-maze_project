This project is the final one for my first year in the ALX Software Engineering program. Following ALX's motto of taking on challenges, I decided to work on a project that is both popular and respected in the industry. It was tough and required a lot of research, but I aimed to make something impressive and unique.
Through MazeCraft, I discovered a deep interest in game development and honed my skills in C++ and SDL2. I learned the importance of planning and iteration in software development.
